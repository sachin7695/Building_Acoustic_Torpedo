Team Tiburon welcomes you to the Software Induction 2021 for Sophomores. This induction consists of a three weeks simulation challenge followed by a personal interview.

A Tiburon Software Member has the following responsibilities:
1. Perception: Develop software to perceive and process the environment using various sensors.
2. Navigation: Control strategies and path planning algorithms to maneuver the robot
3. Simulation: Present a proof of concept before jumping into costly hardware.
4. Hardware Integration: Develop driver code for various peripherals.

This induction process aims to test and prepare a sophomore to undertake all the responsibilities mentioned above.

## Prerequisites:
1. Intermediate knowledge in C++, ROS, SDF/URDF scripting, and Gazebo Simulation.
3. Basic knowledge of Control Systems (PID Controller).
4. Experience in Computer Vision and OpenCV library.
